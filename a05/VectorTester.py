        Function returning k nearest neighbors with distances for each word
        in `words`
        
        We suggest using the nearest-neighbors implementation from scikit-learn.
        Carefully check the documentation regarding the parameters passed to
        the algorithm.
    
        Imagine you want to find 5 nearest neighbors for the words "harry"
        and "ron" using the "cosine" distance metric. Then you would need
        to call `self.find_nearest(["harry", "ron"], k=5, metric="cosine")`.

        The output of the function would then be the following list of lists
        of tuples (LLT) (all words and distances are just example values):
    
        [[('harry', 0.0), ('percy', 0.2), ('hagrid', 0.22), ('neville', 0.24),
          ('snape', 0.25)],
         [('ron', 0.0), ('hermione', 0.22), ('luna', 0.23), ('ginny', 0.25),
        ('tonks', 0.27)]]
        
        The i-th element of the list would correspond to the k nearest neighbors
        for the i-th word in the `words` input list. Each tuple contains a word
        and a distance. The tuples are sorted either by ascending distance.
        
        :param      words:   Words for the nearest neighbors to be found
        :type       words:   list
        :param      metric:  The similarity/distance metric
